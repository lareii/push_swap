üñºÔ∏è Sorting numbers with an optimized stack-based algorithm.

## About
push_swap is an algorithmic project in the 42 curriculum designed to test a student's ability to implement efficient sorting algorithms using two stacks. The goal is to sort a list of integers with the smallest number of predefined operations, such as pushing, swapping, and rotating elements between the stacks. This project emphasizes algorithmic thinking, optimization, and clean code design while introducing students to the complexities of solving problems within specific constraints. Through push_swap, students learn to balance performance and correctness in algorithm development.
